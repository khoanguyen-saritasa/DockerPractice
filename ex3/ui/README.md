<!-- TODO: This section should be removed when a project is started. -->

## Boilerplate info (to be removed)

- Globally replace `saritasa-react-boilerplate` to your project name in *kebab-case*
- Set up the environment
- Delete the `posts` and `home` features
- Fill the root README with relevant data and remove the information about the boilerplate setup
- Adjust CODEOWNERS of your application, make sure you have at least one code reviewer before starting a project 👨‍💻

**And that's it, your're ready to go! 🥷😎**
